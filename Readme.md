### Learning JavaScript, Fizzbuzz and Checkerboard

These were both projects I had done as prework to Mod1.  Links to my original Ruby code (before I knew how to use Ruby) are below.  As an extra bit of getting ready for Mod3, I did the first two exercises in Eloquent JavaScript, Fizzbuzz and Checkerboard, in JavaScript!  I was really excited to realize I could do more than just Ruby.  It took a little bit of trying, and a little bit of Google, but in the end I made both of them work... in my opinion a little nicer looking than my originals!
